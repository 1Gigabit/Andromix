## FAQ

### How to get ARL to phone?

I personally just used StandardNotes to sync text between my phone and my computer.
You may also be able to use KDE connect to send a file containing the ARL in which you can then copy and paste it.

### What does "NotLoggedIn" mean?

Your ARL failed to authenticate with deezer. Set your ARL properly.

### Will there be a way to view download queue?

Unfortunately I am not experienced with websockets.
If someone is and would like to attempt to add functionality, go for it and make a PR.

### Does this download to your phone?

No! It simply requests downloads to be downloaded on a Deemix server.
I personally use AirSonic & Substream (Android) to play music from the downloads on the Deemix server.
